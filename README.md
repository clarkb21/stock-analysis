# Green Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project
 - I was assigned the task to analyze stocks to help a customer make a more informed decision about which stocks their parents should purchase. 
 - I used Excel and VBA to easily create a workbook that displayed the relative information in a user friendly format. 
 - By breaking down the return for each stock, I was able to analyze stock performance to allow my customer to make the most informed decision.

### Purpose
- Using VBA in Excel, the goal was to determine stock performance for specific green stocks during the years 2017 and 2018. 
- By applying what I have learned through VBA, I was able to create an excel spreadsheet that displayed the Ticker name, total daily volume, and return for each stock that I was analyzing. 
- I also created buttons in the workbook to allow easier access for all users, not just those who understand VBA code.
- Finally, I refactored the code to allow it to run quicker and more efficient using one for loop instead of multiple nested loops. 

## Results
### Stock Performance in 2017

- Of the 12 stocks that were recorded and analyzed during this project, 11 of them returned positive values during 2017, meaning the stock was worth more at the end of the year than it was at the beginning of the year. 
- "DQ" and "SEDG" were the two stocks that increased in value the most over the time frame. 
- "TERP" was the sole stock that lost value during the year 2017.
