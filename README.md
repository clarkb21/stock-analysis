# Green Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project
 - I was assigned the task to analyze stocks to help a customer make a more informed decision about which stocks their parents should purchase. 
 - I used Excel and VBA to easily create a workbook that displayed the relative information in a user friendly format. 
 - By breaking down the return for each stock, I was able to analyze stock performance to allow my customer to make the most informed decision.

### Purpose
- Using VBA in Excel, the goal was to determine stock performance for specific green stocks during the years 2017 and 2018. 
- By applying what I have learned through VBA, I was able to create an excel spreadsheet that displayed the Ticker name, total daily volume, and return for each stock that I was analyzing. 
- I also created buttons in the workbook to allow easier access for all users, not just those who understand VBA code.
- Finally, I refactored the code to allow it to run quicker and more efficient using one for loop instead of multiple nested loops.
