# Green Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project
 - I was assigned the task to analyze stocks to help a customer make a more informed decision about which stocks their parents should purchase. 
 - I used Excel and VBA to easily create a workbook that displayed the relative information in a user friendly format. 
 - By breaking down the return for each stock, I was able to analyze stock performance to allow my customer to make the most informed decision.

### Purpose
- Using VBA in Excel, the goal was to determine stock performance for specific green stocks during the years 2017 and 2018. 
- By applying what I have learned through VBA, I was able to create an excel spreadsheet that displayed the Ticker name, total daily volume, and return for each stock that I was analyzing. 
- I also created buttons in the workbook to allow easier access for all users, not just those who understand VBA code.
- Finally, I refactored the code to allow it to run quicker and more efficient using one for loop instead of multiple nested loops. 

## Results
### Stock Performance in 2017

- Of the 12 stocks that were recorded and analyzed during this project, 11 of them returned a positive value during 2017, meaning the stock was worth more at the end of the year than it was at the beginning of the year. 
- "DQ" and "SEDG" were the two stocks that increased in value the most over the time frame. 
- "TERP" was the sole stock that lost value during the year 2017. 
- The return column is color coded to easily show the users if the stock made or lost money during the year.

### Stock Performance in 2018
- Of the 12 stocks that were recorded and analyzed during this project, 10 of them returned a negative value during 2018, meaning those stocks lost money from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. 
- "ENPH" and "RUN" were the two stocks were gained value, showing up as green in the image below. 
- "DQ", which was the initial stock my customer was interested in, lost the most amount of money out of all 12 stocks in 2018. 
- The total daily volume shows the number of stocks that were traded during the entire year.
